# My corpus

## Comparison points
For my corpus, I have decided to look into the various genres I have listened to for the past two years using Spotify Wrapped. From what I can see, I have listened to various genres like rock, pop, soul, media scores et cetera. However, one of the most occuring main genres to me is hip hop. As such, I have decided to create a corpus around rap, specifically using the artists I have listened to the most over the past two years.

For my corpus, I will be using the following artists:
- J. Cole
- Jay-Z
- Kid Cudi
- Kanye West
- Tyler, the Creator
- Vince Staples
- Swae Lee
- Meek Mill
- Mac Miller
- A$AP Rocky
- 21 Savage
- Childish Gambino
- Drake
- Metro Boomin
- Travis Scott
- Pop Smoke
- Frank Ocean

### Representativeness of tracks

Thus, I want to investigate the difference in my 'bubble' in which my understanding and preference of rap songs goes, with some popular tracks that are close in similarity to rap. For this, I will use some of Every Noise at Once's playlists with 10 (sub)genres chosen from the list:

- rap
